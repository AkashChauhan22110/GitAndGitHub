## Repository Basics

- **Initialization:** `git init` - Create a new Git repository in a directory.

- **Adding and Committing Changes:** 
  - `git add <file>` - Stage changes.
  - `git commit -m "commit message"` - Commit staged changes to the repository.

## Branching and Merging

- **Creating Branches:** `git branch <branch_name>` - Create a new branch.
- **Switching Branches:** `git checkout <branch_name>` - Move to a different branch.
- **Merging Branches:** `git merge <branch_name>` - Combine changes from one branch to another.

## Working with Remote Repositories

- **Adding a Remote:** `git remote add <name> <URL>` - Connect your local repository to a remote repository.
- **Pushing Changes:** `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>` - Upload your local commits to a remote repository.
- **Pulling Changes:** `git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>` - Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository to your local branch.

## Handling Conflicts

- **Resolving Conflicts:** Understand how to resolve merge conflicts that arise when Git cannot automatically merge changes.

## History and Inspection

- **Viewing Commit History:** `git log` - Display commit history.
- **Inspecting Changes:** `git diff` - Show changes between commits, branches, etc.

## Undoing Changes

- **Discarding Local Changes:** 
  - `git checkout -- <file>` - Discard changes in a file.
  - `git reset --hard` - Revert to the last commit.
